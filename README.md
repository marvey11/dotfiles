# Marco Wegner's dotfiles

My version of `dotfiles`.

Please only use if you know what you're doing.

Especially the install scripts should be at best be used as a reference only.

Install scripts provided for both bash and PowerShell, the latter mainly in order to provide certain services in the Git Bash environment (aliases, helper scripts, ...) and sym-linking doesn't work from bash scripts.
